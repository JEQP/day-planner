# Work Day Scheduler
Daily Planner This web based app displays segments representing the work day, and allows users to enter and store activites for each hour. The current hour is coloured red, while hours that have passed are gray and hours in the future are green. The time blocks automatically change colour based on the current time. 
The current date is displayed at the top of the page. 
The drop down menu allows the user to select any date and display the schedule for that date, including entering, storing, and retrieving activities.
